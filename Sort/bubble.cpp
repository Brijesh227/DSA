//Unoptimized bubble sort performs the following steps to sort an array from smallest to largest:
// A) Compare array element 0 with array element 1. If element 0 is larger, swap it with element 1.
// B) Now do the same for elements 1 and 2, and every subsequent pair of elements until you hit the end of the array. At this point, the last element in the array will be sorted.
// C) Repeat the first two steps again until the array is sorted.
