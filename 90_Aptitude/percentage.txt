// Formula

1. x% of y = y% of x

2. x is what percentage of y = (x/y)*100        // trick term with "of" is in denominator 
    what percentage of x is y = (y/x)*100   

3. x is what percentage more or less than y = ((x-y)/y) * 100
    // trick term with "than" is in denominator and second term
    // if answer in minus then less else more
